## Goal

I wanted to work on a generative AI project and I already had all these physics abstracts lying around form my previous projects, so I decided to make an abstract generator.

The user inputs a novel paper title and a research category (from arxiv) and then a fresh abstract gets created.

---

## Dataset

- Same dataset from my previous [abstract classifier project](https://github.com/evanfrang/arxiv_classifier)
- This time no grouping of categories, but dumped any category that had fewer than 50 instances in the 100k papers
- For proof of concept, sampled 1% of the 100k papers (â‰ˆ1,000 abstracts)
- 90% used for training, 10% for evaluation
- Training performed locally on GPU

Title: Measuring the Expansion of the Universe and Testing de Sitter

Generated Abstract:
We present a method to measure the Hubble parameter from the expansion rate
of the universe in a de Sitter space. Our method is based on the relation
between the Hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter in a de Sitter
space, which is a generalization of the equation of state parameter. This
relation is used to calculate the deceleration parameter from the Hubble
parameter. We show that the deceleration parameter can be measured from the
Hubble parameter with an accuracy of 1% for a de Sitter universe. We also
present a method to measure the expansion rate of the universe using the
deceleration parameter.

I cut this one off because it started to repeat itself.

Title: A novel method for measuring the Higgs Mass using soft photon breaking limit

Generated Abstract:
We discuss a novel method for measuring the Higgs mass, which uses the
soft photon breaking limit. The method is based on a recent result of the
Particle Data Group, and on a model-independent formula for the soft photon
breaking limit. The formula is shown to be a good fit to the experimental data
and to give a consistent description of the Higgs mass.

This is a completely made up thing. It has some coherent ideas but mostly repeating the prompt.

Title: Using doped silicon wafers to explore paramagnetism in rocks

Generated Abstract:
We present a new method for the study of the paramagnetic properties of
thin films grown on silicon wafers. The method involves measuring the intensity
of the optical signal emitted by the film in the 400-700 nm spectral range
where the absorption is dominated by the paramagnetic phonons. The intensity of
the signal is proportional to the number of paramagnetic phonons in the film.
In order to measure the intensity of the signal we use a system for measuring
the intensity of the electromagnetic field generated by the film. The method
has been tested on several films of silicon and silicon-germanium wafers with
different thicknesses. We show that the method can be used to extract the
magnetic properties of thin films grown on silicon wafers.

This one was a bit iffy like I wonder if there is a paper that does exactly that.
